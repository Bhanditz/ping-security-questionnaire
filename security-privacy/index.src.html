Abstract: 
  This document lists a set of questions that working groups interested in the
  security and privacy impacts of their specifications might ask themselves.
  It is not meant as a "security checklist", nor does filling out this
  questionnaire obviate the group's responsibility to obtain "wide review" of
  a specification's security and privacy properties before publication.
  Instead, this document is meant as a guide through an initial self-review,
  which can provide a later reviewer with valuable context, and help a group
  to focus on important questions in areas where they might lack expertise.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  Adding features to the web is a tricky thing; on the one hand, we want to
  provide developers with access to all the things they need in order to build
  amazing experiences. On the other, we need to ensure that we don't
  accidentally hand over too much power to malicious folks who could abuse it.
  Ideally, careful review of every specification we publish will allow us to
  strike the right balance.

  Working groups can (and should) begin this review process early, of course.
  It's <em>easy</em> to mitigate risks to users on the web <em>before</em> a
  feature is finalized and shipped in user agents. Changing APIs or
  introducing restrictions becomes nigh impossible once the web begins to
  depend on a particular implementation. 

  This document encourages early review by posing a number of questions that
  a working group might consider themselves, before asking for more formal
  review. The intent is to highligh areas which have historically had
  interesting implications on a user's security or privacy, and thereby to
  focus the working group's attention on areas that might previously have been
  overlooked.

  Note: Answering these questions obviously doesn't constitute "wide review" in
  and of itself, but could provide a helpful basis of understanding upon which
  future reviewers can build.

<section>
  <h2 id="questions">Questions to Consider</h2>

  <h3 id="pii">
    Does this specification deal with personally-identifiable information?
  </h3>

  <dfn local-title="personally-identifiable">Personally-identifiable
  information</dfn> (PII) includes a large swath of data which could be used on
  its own, or in combination with other information, to identify a single
  person. The exact definition of what's considered PII varies from jurisdiction
  to jurisdiction, but could certainly include things like a home address, an
  email address, birthdates, usernames, fingerprints etc. Wikipedia has a fairly
  good description at [[PII]].

  If the specification under consideration exposes PII to the web, it's
  important to consider ways to mitigate the obvious impacts. For instance:
 
  *   A feature which uses biometric data (fingerprints or retina scans) could
      refuse to expose the raw data to the web, instead using the raw data only
      to unlock some origin-specific and ephemeral secret and transmitting that
      secret instead.

  *   User mediation could be required, in order to ensure that no data is
      exposed without a user's explicit choice (and hopefully understanding).

  <h3 id="credentials">
    Does this specification deal with high-value data?
  </h3>

  Data which isn't <a>personally-identifiable</a> can still be quite valuable.
  Sign-in credentials (like username/password pairs, or OAuth refresh tokens)
  can be extrememly powerful in the wrong hands, as can financial instruments
  like credit card data.

  Mitigations similar to those in [[#pii]] could be effective.

  <h3 id="location">Does this specification allow an origin access to a user's location?</h3>

  <h3 id="sensors">Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user's device?</h3>

  <h3 id="local-device">Does this specification allow an origin access to aspects of a user's local computing environment?</h3>

  (e.g. screen sizes, installed fonts, installed plugins, bluetooth or network interface identifiers)?

  <h3 id="remote-device">Does this specification allow an origin access to other devices?</h3>

  (e.g. via bluetooth, USB, etc.)?

  <h3 id="native-ui">Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent's native UI?</h3>

  (showing, hiding, or modifying certain details, especially if those details are relevant to security)?

  <h3 id="origin-controlled-data">Does this specification expose origin-controlled data to an origin?</h3>

  over HTTP? (e.g. cookies, `ETag` and `Last Modified` headers)

  via an API? (e.g.`localStorage`)

  <h3 id="temporary-id">Does this specification expose temporary identifiers to the web?</h3>

  (e.g. TLS features like Channel ID, session identifiers/tickets, etc)?

  <h3 id="persistent-id">Does this specification expose persistent details to the web?</h3>

  (device-level,like GPU details, or otherwise)

  Have steps been taken to reduce the entropy these details introduce?

  <h3 id="first-third-party">Does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?</h3>

  (where "first-party" is simply defined as the top-level origin the user theoretically sees in the address bar)

  <h3 id="other-data">Does this specification expose any other data to an origin that it doesn't currently have access to?</h3>

  (e.g. Content Security Policy's violation reports)

  <h3 id="string-to-script">Does this specification create a string-to-script mechanism?</h3>

  (e.g. `eval()` or `setTimeout([string], ...)`)

  <h3 id="script-loading">Does this specification enable a new script loading/execution mechanism?

  (e.g. HTML Imports)? What about style?

  <h3 id="considerations">Does this specification have a "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
    Considerations" section?</h3>
