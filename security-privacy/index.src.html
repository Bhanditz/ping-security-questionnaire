Abstract: 
  This document lists a set of questions that working groups interested in the
  security and privacy impacts of their specifications might ask themselves.
  It is not meant as a "security checklist", nor does filling out this
  questionnaire obviate the group's responsibility to obtain "wide review" of
  a specification's security and privacy properties before publication.
  Instead, this document is meant as a guide through an initial self-review,
  which can provide a later reviewer with valuable context, and help a group
  to focus on important questions in areas where they might lack expertise.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  ISSUE: This document is an incomplete strawman, meant to show a direction for
  further discussion. But it's totally not done yet.

  Adding features to the web is a tricky thing; on the one hand, we want to
  provide developers with access to all the things they need in order to build
  amazing experiences. On the other, we need to ensure that we don't
  accidentally hand over too much power to malicious folks who could abuse it.
  Ideally, careful review of every specification we publish will allow us to
  strike the right balance.

  Working groups can (and should) begin this review process early, of course.
  It's <em>easy</em> to mitigate risks to users on the web <em>before</em> a
  feature is finalized and shipped in user agents. Changing APIs or
  introducing restrictions becomes nigh impossible once the web begins to
  depend on a particular implementation. 

  This document encourages early review by posing a number of questions that
  a working group might consider themselves, before asking for more formal
  review. The intent is to highligh areas which have historically had
  interesting implications on a user's security or privacy, and thereby to
  focus the working group's attention on areas that might previously have been
  overlooked.

  Note: Answering these questions obviously doesn't constitute "wide review" in
  and of itself, but could provide a helpful basis of understanding upon which
  future reviewers can build.

<!-- Big Text: Threats -->
<section>
  <h2 id="threats">Threat Models</h2>

  "Security" and "Privacy" are big concepts. In order to pare them down to
  something which could feasibly guide working groups' decisions, let's consider
  the types of threats to both which the web makes possible:

  <h3 id="passive-network">Passive Network Attackers</h3>

  A <dfn>passive network attacker</dfn> has read-access to the bits going over
  the wire between users and the servers they're communicating with. She can't
  <em>modify</em> the bytes, but she can collect and analyze them.

  Due to the decentralized nature of the internet, and the general level of
  interest in user activity, it's reasonable to assume that practically every
  unencrypted bit that's bouncing around the network of proxies, routers, and
  servers you're using right now is being read by someone. It's equally likely
  that some of these attackers are doing their best to understand the encrypted
  bits as well (though that requires significantly more effort).

  *   The IETF's "Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack" document [[RFC7258]] is
      useful reading, outlining some of the impacts on privacy that this
      assumption entails.

  *   Governments aren't the only concern; your local coffee shop is likely to
      be gathering information on its customers, your ISP at home is likely to
      be doing the same.

  <h3 id="active-network">Active Network Attackers</h3>

  An <dfn>active network attacker</dfn> has both read- and write-access to the
  bits going over the wire between users and the servers they're communicating
  with. She can collect and analyze data, but also modify it in-flight,
  injecting and manipulating JavaScript and HTML at will. This is more common
  than you might expect, for both benign and malicious purposes:

  *   ISPs and caching proxies regularly cache and compress images before
      delivering them to users in an effort to reduce data usage. This can be
      especially useful for users on low-bandwidth, high-latency devices like
      phones.
      
  *   ISPs also regularly inject JavaScript [[COMCAST]] and other identifiers
      [[VERIZON]]for less benign purposes.

  *   If your ISP is willing to modify your traffic for profit, it's difficult
      to believe that state-level attackers would remain passive.

  <h3 id="sop-violations">Same-Origin Policy Violations</h3>

  The <dfn>same-origin policy</dfn> is the cornerstone of security on the web;
  one origin should not have direct access to another origin's data (the policy
  is more formally defined in Section 3 of [[RFC6454]]). A corollary to this
  policy is that an origin should not have direct access to data that isn't
  associated with <em>any</em> origin: the contents of a user's hard drive,
  for instance. Various kinds of attacks bypass this protection in one way or
  another. For example:

  *   <dfn local-title="XSS">Cross-site scripting attacks</dfn> involve an
      attacker tricking an origin into executing attacker-controlled code in
      the context of a target origin.

  *   <dfn local-title="CSRF">Cross-site request forgery attacks</dfn> trick
      user agents into exerting a user's ambient authority on sites where
      they've logged in by submitting requests on their behalf.

  *   Data leakage occurs when bits of information are inadvertantly made
      available cross-origin, either explicitly via CORS headers [[CORS]],
      or implicitly, via side-channel attacks like [[TIMING]].

<!-- Big Text: Questions -->
<section>
  <h2 id="questions">Questions to Consider</h2>

  <h3 id="pii">
    Does this specification deal with personally-identifiable information?
  </h3>

  <dfn local-title="personally-identifiable">Personally-identifiable
  information</dfn> (PII) includes a large swath of data which could be used on
  its own, or in combination with other information, to identify a single
  person. The exact definition of what's considered PII varies from jurisdiction
  to jurisdiction, but could certainly include things like a home address, an
  email address, birthdates, usernames, fingerprints etc. Wikipedia has a fairly
  good description at [[PII]].

  If the specification under consideration exposes PII to the web, it's
  important to consider ways to mitigate the obvious impacts. For instance:
 
  *   A feature which uses biometric data (fingerprints or retina scans) could
      refuse to expose the raw data to the web, instead using the raw data only
      to unlock some origin-specific and ephemeral secret and transmitting that
      secret instead.

  *   User mediation could be required, in order to ensure that no data is
      exposed without a user's explicit choice (and hopefully understanding).

  <h3 id="credentials">
    Does this specification deal with high-value data?
  </h3>

  Data which isn't <a>personally-identifiable</a> can still be quite valuable.
  Sign-in credentials (like username/password pairs, or OAuth refresh tokens)
  can be extrememly powerful in the wrong hands, as can financial instruments
  like credit card data. Making this data available to JavaScript, for instance,
  could expose it to <a>XSS</a> attacks and <a>active network attackers</a> who
  could inject code to read and exfiltrate the data.

  <h3 id="persistent-state">Does this specification introduce new persistent state for an origin?</h3>

  For example:

  *    Service Worker [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] intercept all requests made by an
       origin, allowing sites to function perfectly even when offline. A
       maliciously-injected service worker, however, would be devastating (as
       documented in that spec's
       <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations">security
       considerations section</a>). They mitigate the risks an <a>active network
       attacker</a> or <a>XSS</a> vulnerability present by requiring an
       encrypted and authenticated connection in order to register a service
       worker.

  <h3 id="other-data">Does this specification expose any other data to an origin that it doesn't currently have access to?</h3>

  As noted above in [#sop-violations], the <a>same-origin policy</a> is an
  important security barrier that new features need to carefully consider.
  If a specification exposes details about another origin's state, or allows
  POST or GET requests to be made to another origin, the consequences can be
  severe.

  *   Content Security Policy [[CSP]] unintentionally exposed redirect targets
      cross-origin by allowing one origin to infer details about another origin
      through violation reports. [[HOMAKOV]] The working group eventually
      mitigated the risk by reducing a policy's granularity after a redirect.

  *   Beacon [[BEACON]] allows an origin to send POST requests to an endpoint
      on another origin. They decided that this feature didn't add any new
      attack surface above and beyond what normal form submission entails, so
      no extra mitigation was necessary.

  <h3 id="string-to-script">Does this specification enable new script execution mechanisms?</h3>
  
  * New string-to-script mechanism? (e.g. `eval()` or `setTimeout([string], ...)`)

  * New script loading mechansim? (e.g. HTML Imports)

  * What about style?

  <h3 id="location">Does this specification allow an origin access to a user's location?</h3>

  A user's location is highly-desirable information for a variety of use cases.
  It is also, understandably, information which many users are reluctant to
  share, as it can be both highly identifying, and potentially creepy. New
  features which make use of geolocation information, or which expose it to the
  web in new ways should carefully consider the ways in which the risks of
  unfettered access to a user's location could be mitigated. For instance:

  *   Geolocation information can serve many use cases at a much less granular
      precision than the user agent can offer. For instance, a resturaunt
      recommendation can be generated by asking for a user's city-level location
      rather than a position accurate to the centimeter.

  *   A recent Geofencing proposal [[GEOFENCING]] ties itself to service workers
      and therefore to encrypted and authenticated origins.

  <h3 id="sensors">Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user's device?</h3>

  <h3 id="local-device">Does this specification allow an origin access to aspects of a user's local computing environment?</h3>

  (e.g. screen sizes, installed fonts, installed plugins, bluetooth or network interface identifiers)?

  <h3 id="remote-device">
    Does this specification allow an origin access to other devices?
  </h3>

  Specifically, it's interesting whether or not this specification allows access
  to devices on a user's local network that would be otherwise inaccessible to
  a web origin. In particular, connection via Bluetooth and USB should be
  carefully evaluated to avoid exposing devices to the web that aren't created
  with the web in mind; doing so has security implications, as these devices
  may not be hardened against malicious input as well as they should be.

  *   The Network Service Discovery API [[DISCOVERY]] recommends CORS preflights
      before granting access to a device, and requires user agents to involve
      the user with a permission request of some kind. The spec's
      <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/discovery-api/Overview.html#security-and-privacy-considerations">Security
      and privacy considerations"</a> section has more details.

  *   Likewise, the Web Bluetooth [[BLUETOOTH]] has an extensive discussion of
      <a href="https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/#security-and-privacy-considerations">"Security
      and privacy considerations"</a>, which is worth reading as an example for
      similar work.


  <h3 id="native-ui">Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent's native UI?</h3>

  (showing, hiding, or modifying certain details, especially if those details are relevant to security)?

  <h3 id="origin-controlled-data">Does this specification expose origin-controlled data to an origin?</h3>

  over HTTP? (e.g. cookies, `ETag` and `Last Modified` headers)

  via an API? (e.g.`localStorage`)

  <h3 id="temporary-id">Does this specification expose temporary identifiers to the web?</h3>

  (e.g. TLS features like Channel ID, session identifiers/tickets, etc)?

  <h3 id="persistent-id">Does this specification expose persistent details to the web?</h3>

  (device-level,like GPU details, or otherwise)

  Have steps been taken to reduce the entropy these details introduce?

  <h3 id="first-third-party">Does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?</h3>

  (where "first-party" is simply defined as the top-level origin the user theoretically sees in the address bar)

  <h3 id="considerations">
    Does this specification have a "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
    Considerations" section?
  </h3>

  Not every feature has security or privacy impacts. Many, many features do.
  Documenting the various concerns that have cropped up in one form or another
  is a good way to help implementers and authors understand the risks that a
  feature presents, and ensure that adequate mitigations are in place.
